## Overview

The [DEEP2 Survey](http://deep.ps.uci.edu/) is an extragalactic survey conducted
by the University of California to obtain deep spectra for $\sim$50,000 faint
galaxies at redshifts of $0 < z < 1.4$. These spectra have provided accurate
redshifts for $\approx$40,000 galaxies. While the spectra were primarily used
to determine distances/redshifts using two emission lines, a subset of the
sample contains spectral coverage that span 3700--5010 Angstroms, enabling
gas-phase chemical abundance determination.

Using the [publicly available data](http://deep.ps.uci.edu/DR4/home.html), I
identified a large sample of 28 galaxies with detection of
$[{\rm O~{\small III}}]\lambda4363$, a gas temperature diagnostics.
