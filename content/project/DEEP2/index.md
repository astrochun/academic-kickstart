## Overview

The [DEEP2 Survey](http://deep.ps.uci.edu/) is an extragalactic survey conducted
by the University of California to obtain deep optical spectra for $\sim$50,000 faint
galaxies at redshifts of $0 < z < 1.4$. These spectra have provided accurate
redshifts for $\approx$40,000 galaxies. While the spectra were primarily used
to determine distances/redshifts using two emission lines, a subset of the
sample (4,140 galaxies) contains spectral coverage that span 3700--5010 Angstroms,
enabling gas-phase chemical abundance determination.

Using the [publicly available data](http://deep.ps.uci.edu/DR4/home.html), I
identified a large sample of 28 galaxies with detection of
$[{\rm O~{\small III}}]\lambda4363$, a gas temperature diagnostics.

This work, titled "_Metal-poor, Strongly Star-forming Galaxies in the DEEP2 Survey:
The Relationship between Stellar Mass, Temperature-based Metallicity, and Star
Formation Rate_", is published in the

## _Spitzer_ follow-up imaging to characterize stellar population

While the spectra enabled us to characterize the interstellar gas properties
of these metal-poor galaxies, understanding the stellar properties of these
$[{\rm O~{\small III}}]\lambda4363$-detected galaxies requires observations
in the infrared to detect the light from low-mass stars.  Using the
[InfraRed Array Camera (IRAC)](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/irac/) on the
NASA's [_Spitzer Space Telescope_](http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/), I
obtained deep imaging at 3.6 $\mu$m.

These observations demonstrated that these galaxies are very faint, and can
be classified as "dwarf" galaxies. In addition, our work illustrated a strong
evolution in the mass--metallicity relation, $(1+z)^{-1.45\^{+0.61}\_{-0.76}}$.
Specifically, we find that lower mass galaxies ($4\times10^8~M_{\odot}$) built
up their metal content 1.6 times more rapidly than higher mass galaxies
($10\^{10}~M_{\odot}$). We also found that there is not a secondary
dependence on star formation in the mass--metallicity relation.

This work is now published in the
[_Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society_](http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stz3047)
as a first-author paper for Drew Weldon, a former undergraduate astronomy major at the
UofA and now attending UC Riverside for graduate school.
