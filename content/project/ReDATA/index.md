There has been a growing need for digital preservation to enable open and
reproducible science.  Data repositories, such as,
[Dataverse](https://dataverse.org/), [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), and
[Figshare](https://figshare.com/) are being used across all disciplines,
including science, humanities, medicine, and technology. These repository
services focus on following the guiding data principles of
[FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/)
(Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable).
