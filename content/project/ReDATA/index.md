## Overview

There has been a growing need for digital preservation to enable open and
reproducible science.  One of the major drivers for researchers is the
requirement from federal agencies (e.g., NSF, NASA, NIH, DoE, etc)
of a data management plan. Data repositories, such as,
[Dataverse](https://dataverse.org/), [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), and
[Figshare](https://figshare.com/) are being used across all disciplines,
including science, humanities, medicine, and technology. These repository
services focus on following the guiding data principles of
[FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/)
(Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable).

In addition to these public repositories, R-1 universities have been providing
institutional data repositories to serve the greater needs of their university.
These repositories also enable university administration to track
the research outputs and productivity.

Motivated by a number of factors, the University of Arizona Libraries is leading
the effort to develop and sustain a data repository with funding from the
[Provost Investment Fund](https://provost.arizona.edu/provost-investment-fund).
The repository, called ReDATA, will be hosted through an institutional Figshare
site.

More information about the data repository is available
