## Overview

There has been a growing needs for data publishing and digital preservation to
enable open and reproducible science.  One of the major drivers for researchers
is the requirement from federal agencies (e.g., NSF, NASA, NIH, DoE)
of a [data management plan](https://data.library.arizona.edu/data-management-plans).
Data repositories, such as, [Dataverse](https://dataverse.org/),
[Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), and [Figshare](https://figshare.com/) are being
used across all disciplines, including science, humanities, medicine, and
technology to satisfy funder's requirements and other needs (e.g., publishers
requirements). These repository services focus on following the guiding data
principles of [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/)
(Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable).

In addition to these public repositories, R-1 universities have been providing
institutional data repositories to serve the greater needs of their university.
These repositories also enable university administration to track
research output and productivity.

Motivated by a number of factors, the [University of Arizona Libraries](https://new.libary.arizona.edu)
is leading the effort to develop and sustain a data repository with funding from the
[Provost Investment Fund](https://provost.arizona.edu/provost-investment-fund).
The repository, called ReDATA, will be hosted through an
[institutional Figshare](https://knowledge.figshare.com/institutions) site.

More information about ReDATA is available
[here](https://data.library.arizona.edu/services/ua-research-data-repository).

In my current role as Research Data Systems Integration Specialist, I:
  * Develop front- and/or back-end software to enable and automate
    identity and access management, data curation, and data preservation,
    and deploying them on cloud infrastructure
  * Engage with major campus stakeholders to identify and
    develop workflows for integrating ReDATA with existing library, campus
    computing, and research administration systems, such as, single-sign on
    (SSO) with the University's enterprise-level Shibboleth system,
    [ORCiD](https://orcid.org/), and [UofA HPC](http://hpc.arizona.edu/)
    infrastructure
  * Engage with researchers across campus to use the data
    repository for open and reproducible science
  * Participate in discussions regarding data repository
    policies.

### Announcements

#### Seeking aditional deposits in our closed beta phase

[2020-06-01] Access to ReDATA service is currently by request only.
Please contact us at [data-management@arizona.edu](data-management@arizona.edu)


#### Service is publicly available. Seeking Early Adopters

[2020-03-01] We are looking for early adopters to deposit research
datasets, code, media, and other materials and to provide feedback on process
and policies, while acting as champions for the repository.

If you’d like to influence how UA’s public research data repository will
operate, we would like to work with you! As an early adopter, you’ll be able
to work directly with the data repository team.  Please contact us at:
[data-management@arizona.edu](data-management@arizona.edu)
