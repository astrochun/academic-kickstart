## Overview

There has been a growing need for digital preservation to enable open and
reproducible science.  One of the major drivers for researchers is the
requirement from federal agencies (e.g., NSF, NASA, NIH, DoE)
of a [data management plan](https://data.library.arizona.edu/data-management-plans).
Data repositories, such as, [Dataverse](https://dataverse.org/),
[Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), and [Figshare](https://figshare.com/) are being
used across all disciplines, including science, humanities, medicine, and
technology to satisfy funder's requirements and other needs. These repository
services focus on following the guiding data principles of
[FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/)
(Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable).

In addition to these public repositories, R-1 universities have been providing
institutional data repositories to serve the greater needs of their university.
These repositories also enable university administration to track
research output and productivity.

Motivated by a number of factors, the University of Arizona Libraries is leading
the effort to develop and sustain a data repository with funding from the
[Provost Investment Fund](https://provost.arizona.edu/provost-investment-fund).
The repository, called ReDATA, will be hosted through an
[institutional Figshare](https://knowledge.figshare.com/institutions) site.

More information about the data repository is available
[here](https://data.library.arizona.edu/services/ua-research-data-repository).

In my current role as Research Data Systems Integration Specialist, I help with
  * Technical oversight and software development.  This includes engaging with
    major campus stakeholders to identify and develop workflows for integrating
    the research data repository system with existing library, campus computing,
    and research administration systems, such as, single-sign on (SSO) with
    the University's enterprise-level Shibboleth system, [ORCiD](https://orcid.org/),
    and [UofA HPC](http://hpc.arizona.edu/) and [CyVerse](https://cyverse.org/)
    cyberinfrastructure
  * Conduct outreach to engage researchers across campus to use the data
    repository to satisfy funder's mandates and for open and reproducible science
  * Participate in discussions regarding data repository curation and governance
    policies.
  * Routine management and maintenance of the data repository

### Announcement: Early Adopters Needed

For Spring 2020, we are looking for early adopters to deposit research
datasets, code, media, and other materials and to provide feedback on process
and policies, while acting as champions for the repository.

If you’d like to influence how UA’s public research data repository will
operate, we would like to work with you! As an early adopter, you’ll be able
to work directly with the data repository team.  Please contact us at:
[data-management@email.arizona.edu](data-management@email.arizona.edu)

### Upcoming Talks and Events

We are planning a number of events in 2020.  Events will include:
* Weekly drop-in at the CATalyst Studios for help with depositing data
* Informational talks and demos at IT Summit InterACTIVE, and Research Bazaar
