## Overview

The Subaru 8.2-meter telescope has stared for over 30 nights at one particular
region of the northern sky with one of the most sensitive optical imagers in
the world, Suprime-Cam. This camera enables images to be taken over a large
part of the sky that is comparable to the angular extent of the Moon. The large
area allows us to look at hundreds of thousands of galaxies simultaneously.
Why stare for so long? To identify some of the faintest galaxies in the early
universe! To do so, the survey utilized a technique called "narrowband imaging"
to pick up emission from hydrogen and oxygen gas that reside within galaxies.

Using the MMT, Keck, and Subaru observatories, my collaborators and I have
targeted some of these faint galaxies with optical and near-infrared
spectrographs. We found a rare population of galaxies that are rapidly forming
at an unexpected rate. Many of these galaxies show signs of interactions with
other nearby galaxies (see below). We believe that these interactions trigger
the extreme bursts of star formation that we see. With detections of a very
weak line, [OIII]Î»4363, we were able to determine that these galaxies do not
have significant heavy elements. In fact, a few of our galaxies have the most
metal pristine gas seen for galaxies outside the local Universe. I am trying to
understand why these galaxies have so few metals. One interpretation is that
these galaxy interactions can drive new metal pristine gas into the galaxies,
\making it appear "metal-poor" and fueling recent star formation. You can
find more information in our paper.
